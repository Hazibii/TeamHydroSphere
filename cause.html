	<h1>The Causes of Water Pollution</h1>
		<p>
            Sewage: pollution can enter the ocean directly. Sewage or polluting substances flow through sewage, rivers, or drainages directly into the ocean.<br>
            Toxic chemicals from industries: industrial and agricultural waste is another most common form of waste that gets directly discharged into the ocean.
            Dumping toxicliquids in the ocean directly affects the marine life.<br>
            Land runoff: another source of pollution in the ocean. This occurs when water infiltrates the soil to its maximum extent and the excess water flows over 
            the land and into the ocean.<br>
            Large scale oil spills: Ship pollution is a huge source of ocean pollution, the most devastating effect of which is oil spills. Crude oil lasts for years
            in the ocean and is extremely toxic to marine life.<br>
            Ocean mining: is yet another source of ocean pollution. Ocean mining sites drill and create sulphide deposits up to three and a half thousand metres 
            down the ocean.<br>
            Littering: Pollution from the atmosphere is, believe it or not, a huge source of ocean pollution. This occurs when objects that are far inland are
            blown by the wind over long distances and end up in the ocean. <br>
